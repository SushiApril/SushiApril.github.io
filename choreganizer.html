    <h2> Inspiration </h2>
    The main inspiration for a chore application came from my having roommates and my experiences with them as a college student. With my team, we took on the responsibility to tackle important issues in communication, task delegation, and timely completion of tasks. 
    <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
    <p> College student households may find it difficult to have consistency in the completion of chores around the house due to the neglect of chores and lack of responsibility; ultimately, leading to stress and discord among roommates. </p>
    <h2> Competetive Analysis</h2>
    <h3> Motivation and Inspiration</h3>
    <p> We started off by researching our competitors. Following Sun Tzu's words "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer". We did our best in finding the weaknesses and strengths of each application so that our app can have all their strengths and compensate their weaknesses.</p>
    <h3> Result</h3>

    <h3> Observation </h3>
     <p> Through the Analysis we found out that most of thee apps were not available offline, were not compatible with multiple platforms, and did not allow collaboration between users for tasks. Now that we knew what we were up against we went to the users to ask what they would want from a chore app.</p>

    <h2> User Feedback</h2> </a>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p> We used google forms which we distributed through various platforms like Instagram, Reddit, and Discord. Participants were asked questions about their challenges with chore distribution between roommates and what they would want from a chore organization app. </p>
    <h3> Result </h3>
    Through the data collected we found out that the most requested feature is the notify user of pending task, as many participants experienced their roommates not doing their chores on time. This would remind them about their task and take away their chance to use the excuse "I forgot". Additionally, participants were a huge fan of being able to use the app on multiple platforms. Moreover, participants did not like the idea of gamifaction of chores since the rewards would most likely serve no real purpose in real life or in app. 
    <br>
    <p> Now that we knew what the users wanted and did not want, we moved on to make sample users through making personas</p>

    <h2> Personas</h2>
    <h3> Inspiration</h3>
    <p> the main inspiration for the portfolios was the data collected from user surveys, we wanted to find out the main points and circumstances of the participants in order to make the personas. We made 2 personas which captured the majority of the user base.</p>

    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p> I designed the app through figma incorporating all the user needs as well as UI/UX designs in order to make for a streamlined process for creating and assigning tasks.</p>
    <h3>Result</h3>

    <h3> Scope for improvement</h3>
    <p> Give the user the ability to change the color scheme of their app</p>
